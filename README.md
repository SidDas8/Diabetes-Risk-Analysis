# Diabetes-Risk-Analysis

- Collaborated with 3 associates to investigate historical and demographic factors influencing diabetes prevalence among Pima Indians, providing insights for health policy improvements and diabetes prevention strategies.
- Utilized R for conducting correlation matrix and box plot visualizations to explore relationships between health metrics and diabetes prevalence.
- Implemented Boxâ€™s M test to assess covariance matrix homogeneity, assessed QDA performance metrics (precision, recall, F1 score) for predicting diabetes onset, and employed PCA to understand variance contribution of health metrics.
